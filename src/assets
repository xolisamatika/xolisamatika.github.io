The /cv-portfolio-website/cv-portfolio-website/src/assets directory is intended to hold images, icons, or other media files used throughout the website. Since you have not specified any particular assets to include, I will create the directory structure without any files, as it is intentionally left blank for now.

src/assets is intentionally left blank.
